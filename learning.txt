As a student learning about Git and version control, I understand that cloning allows me to copy a remote repository from GitHub to my local machine, so I can work on the project offline. Editing locally means I can make changes to the files on my computer, test new features, or fix bugs. Once I'm satisfied with my work, I can sync my changes back to GitHub by pushing them, ensuring that my contributions are saved and shared with others. This process helps me collaborate effectively and keep track of different versions of my code.
