Hello! My name is Christian Alain MUKESHIMANA. I am currently a student at ALX, where I am on a journey to become a skilled software engineer. I created this repository as part of my learning path, specifically to demonstrate my understanding of Git and GitHub fundamentals.
This space will be used to host various projects and assignments from the ALX program. I'm focused on developing strong collaborative skills and using version control to track my progress and manage my code efficient.
